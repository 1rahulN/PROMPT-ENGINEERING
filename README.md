# PROMPT-ENGINEERING
The project appears to involve prompt engineering using LangChain, a library designed for building applications with language models. This project likely includes techniques and tools for creating effective prompts, leveraging LangChain to interact with large language models, and possibly includes examples or notebooks for demonstration.
